# WGPU Tutorial

Working through a few WGPU learning resources. Hoping that this is a good way to get going with graphics programming in Rust.

## Resources

- [Learn WGPU](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/) - a Rust based WGPU tutorial
- [WGPU Fundamentals](https://webgpufundamentals.org/) - covers WGPU concepts with Javascript examples. Will see where/if this differs from the Rust API
